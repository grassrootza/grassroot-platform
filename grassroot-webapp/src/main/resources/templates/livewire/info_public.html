          Grassroot LiveWire is a service that connects community leaders to newsrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grassroot is s set of tools for organizing in low-income and marginalized
          communities. It works on any phone, with any connection. Having grown 10x in the last year,
          it now reaches 35,000 users, with over 6,000 meetings, votes and actions called in total.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grassroot LiveWire is a new service, built with the support of Code for Africaâ€™s innovateAFRICA fund
          and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It enables media to far more easily be informed of events
          and organizing activity in communities and contact groups mobilizing about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          LiveWire works by enabling community leaders, who organize groups of more than 100 people through
          the Grassroot platform, to send out simple press notices and releases. Urgent releases by qualifying
          groups are distributed automatically, while notices of upcoming meetings are reviewed by the Grassroot
          team prior to distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grassroot LiveWire notices are distributed to newsrooms across the country. Full LiveWire subscribers
          can also access lists of community leaders in various parts of the country to contact for news stories.
